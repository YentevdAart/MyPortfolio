      <h3> Inclusion & Diversity </h3> 
      <h4>CliÃ«nt: City Council of Amsterdam </h4>
       <li>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>This was a team project in my theme semester Behavioral Design (3rd year of my CMD course).
            I chose this project because I think more attention should be paid to making a good work environment. Especially now, as more and more employees struggle with burnout symptoms.
            
            This project was mainly focused on changing current behaviour into the desired behaviour. </p>
        <p>Behavioral Statement:</p>
        <p> How could we help employees of the Financial services Department of the City Council of Amsterdam to resolve or prevent undesirable behaviour in the workplace, by encouraging them to dare to address fellow colleagues, by breaking the hierarchy and by eliminating fear of angry reactions or discomfort when entering into conversations? </p>

         <p>Phase where we tried to get answers to the questions; What are the expectations of the client? Who is the user? What is important to this person? Why is this important to this person?</p>

          Gaining knowledge of Inclusion and diversity on different work floors, through listening to podcasts
          and reading articles that were relevant to the topic. Reviewing the current situation at the FD department by reading their Implementation 
          Plan Inclusion and Diversity City Council of Amsterdam. Research has shown that 12% of FD colleagues experience exclusion in the 
          workplace. This includes verbal abuse, discrimination and bullying. The Amsterdam city council does already provide training
          on exclusivity and inclusiveness. Quotes of FD employees tell us indicate that exclusivity definitely takes place in Amsterdam's 
          FD department. We want to focus on the employees who belong to the LGBTQ+ community because this is the largest group 
          affected by this according to internal surveys.

          <p>For the observation, we went to the office of Amsterdam's FD department to see what the current work situation is. </p>
            
            <p>Interesting findings: </p>
          <p>- Signs about inclusiveness and about creating a nice working atmosphere (1).</p>
            <p>- Poster they put up at the coffee/lunch spot(2).</p>
           <p> - Trying to create a nice working atmosphere by putting table tennis tables
            and workstations with a lounge sofa and comfortable sitting chairs (3).</p>
            <p>- Lots of places where you can get together to chat, have lunch or drink coffee.</p>
            <p>- Because of corona, many people work from home, so there are not many
            people in the office.</p>

         <h4>Defining + Ideation</h4>
         <p>Creating a point of view of the user by collecting user needs and insights.</p>
         <p>By incorporating all the key insights and conclusions from this phase, we arrived at an overall solution. Which states the following:
        <p>1) You must first acknowledge the problem. It turned out that a lot of attention was already being paid 
        to this through posters at the workplace, organising workshops and their own implementation plan for 
        inclusion & diversity. </p>
        <p>2) Preventing the problem, this part of the solution was also being tackled by the city council. By 
        giving workshops, they draw attention to the problem. The more attention for the problem the more 
        employees become aware of it. Through this aware workplace, the problems will be treated in time 
        and in some cases prevented. Because not enough workers participate in the workshops yet. And that
        more regularly workshops should be given as repetition of desired behavior. Is the reason why the 
        FD department does not yet have an inclusive workplace. </p>
      <p>3) A protocol for guiding colleagues in resolving undesirable behavior. This protocol will apply to 
        everyone in the FD department. A digital application could help in this process. In which every 
        employee is encouraged to report difficult situations in the workplace using the app. This ensures that 
        the colleague concerned can enter a conversation calmly and prepared. Thus avoiding the risk of 
        heated conversations.</p>

          <p>Collecting votes in the FD department with a poster. The poster contained a statement: "Have you ever experienced exclusion in the workplace?" Employees could then use a sticker to answer with yes or no. You noticed that many people struggled to answer yes. Yet 75% had indicated that they did experienced exclusion, they did indicate that they liked to keep their answer anonymous.</p>

           <p> Common insights were:</p>
           <p> - Discussions many people find difficult.</p>
           <p>- People are pigeonholed.</p>
           <p> - The problem is not only in the LGBTQ+ community, as discrimination is also experienced.</p>
           <p> - Hierarchy plays a role in resolving issues.</p>
            <p>- Confidants and other people in high positions are expected to solve the problem.</p>
          <p>- People find giving feedback or addressing others on unwanted behavior hard.  Most wouldn't dare
            because they are afraid to be attacked or afraid of becomming the laughingstock.

          <p>We used 3 methods in this focus group:(1) Brainwriting, to find out what people mean by an inclusive workplace. (2) Reverse brainstorming, to gather even more possible pain points. (3)Sue framework, this gives you a behavioural analysis of the target group and insight on the unconscious factors that promote or hold back their behaviour. Using the analysis, we were able to find the opportunities for behavioural influence.</p>
            
           <p> New insights where:</p>
            <p>- Pains: Shutting out, ignoring, gossiping, no respect and appreciation and the
            denial of the problem.</p>
           <p> - Gains: Feeling more involved, doing a better job, being able to express yourself and
            promotes mental health.</p>
            <p>- Current behaviour: pigeonholing people. placing.</p>
            <p>- Desired behaviour: Seeing and treating people equally.</p>
           <p>- Habits: Assuming someone else will solve it .</p>
            <p>- Anxieties: Being afraid of judgements from others.</p>

        <br>- Put indication of time on the start screen.
        <br>- The question, "Are you afraid to start a conversation?" Should be asked first asked.
        <br>- A link to intranet so users can see information and details of their colleagues.
        <br>- The motivational intermediate pages should bring a stimulating but general message.
        <br> - Give a choice earlier in the app to talk to a confidant.
        <br>- Approach could be more comprehensive with more pictures, tips and sentiment.
        <br>- Style could be a bit better and use more images/pictures.</p>
