            I am Yente van der Aart (22), UX/UI designer, student at the University of applied science Amsterdam. 

<br>Currently, I'm working as UX/UI design intern at the Rabobank.
<br>During my studies I specialised in behavioral design.
<br>I completed a minor in International Global Communication at the school ISCOM Paris. With this minor, I gained my knowledge in marketing and branding and explored designing with a commercial purpose. Living abroad has increased my intercultural experiences and evolved me as a person. <br>
		
<br>Besides my studies, I like to engage in interior design and explore eco-friendly ways of housing and living. My daily goal is trying to be the best version of myself.
